## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
Some outside resources I used to help me complete my submission would be the forum: stackoverflow, on helping me find basic syntax and reading more about the structures of HTML and CSS. Also, since I am enrolled in a Web development class using HTML / CSS, I also used my notes I took in lectures to help me understand and learn more.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I think a challenge that I encountered in creating this submission would be utilizing Github to submit my work. In my previous courses, there was always a submission box online that I can drag my code files to and submit which was very simple. However, like my Web Development class and this pre-work, Github was used in order to submit projects. Creating repos, cloning repos, publishing changes, and more are all very ambiguous to me still and I am still learning to get comfortable with Github. How I overcame this was watching the video on the pre-work page on using Github as well as using my professor's video on creating Github repos. After doing this, I became very comfortable on creating and submitting this assignment.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Some questions I have about completing this submission would be how big sites such as Instagram store data. By using HTML / JS / CSS, I am able to understand creating simple websites, however, I am very intrigued on how bigger websites would save data. More so, what kind of data structures do they use ? This is one of my many questions I ponder on the daily and I am very eager to learn more in this Summer internship.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more hours to work on this, I would implement the counter so that the user can see how many tries they took to win instead of going to the F12 log. I would also change up the styling a bit more, and adding more buttons to give the user much more of a challenge.
